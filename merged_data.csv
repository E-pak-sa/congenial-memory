1,"Hi 2X.  This is a throwaway.  

So, I've recently been put on Wellbutrin, about a month ago, for depression, which is scaring me a lot.  But I'm not sure if my depression is the cause of my sadness with my boyfriend (and school, but that's another can of worms) or if the problems with school/boyfriend are causing the depression.

My boyfriend and I have been together 2.5 years, and we moved in together in May.  he moved across the country for it (I had gone to grad school across the country).  So, we are far away from any family support.  At that time I was *so sure* that we were going to be together for quite some time, I really was.  I'd never felt that way before.

Now fast forward about six months.  I want to end things with him.  It scares me to be with the same person since I was 21 (I'm 24) and he feels like he wants to be with me forever.  I do not feel that way anymore.  I don't feel the same way about him as I did.  At all.  As clich as it is, I love him but I'm not *in* love with him.  

However, I don't know if this is all because of this depression shit, or real feelings.  Anyone have any advice? It would be so greatly appreciated.

TL;DR--is my depression causing me to not love my boyfriend anymore?",Dataset_saving\train\pos\test_subject1445.xml

1,"Oops, didn't reply to the second part of your question.  The course thing--been feeling this way since about...April-ish?  And the boyfriend thing--about late June-ish, about 2 months after we moved in together.",Dataset_saving\train\pos\test_subject1445.xml
1,"Thank you :)  It is nice to talk to positive people.  I'm usually a fairly outgoing positive person, but the last few months have definitely taken a toll on me.",Dataset_saving\train\pos\test_subject1445.xml
1,"I've been on the medication about a month.  I mean, I wasn't expecting happy daisies and roses and unicorns out my butt soon after taking it, but I can't tell if the way I feel is because the medicine isn't the right medicine, or if it really is everything else. :/  Definitely a really awkward place to be.  Especially because if I break up with my boyfriend, he'd have to move back in with his parents across the country (U.S.) and that would be it for us.  No real chance of reconciliation.",Dataset_saving\train\pos\test_subject1445.xml
1,"Hi everybody.  I've been a lurker on reddit for a little while, but I need somebody, anybody to talk to.  
I was diagnosed with depression about a month ago, and was put on Wellbutrin.  That's all fine, but I feel like nothing will change unless I change what is going on in my life, but I feel like I can't.
I'm currently in my 2nd year of a 2 year Master's program, and honestly?  I don't want the degree. I have realized that science research is not my thing, at all.  I don't even slightly enjoy it.  The only thing I enjoy about it is that i can be a TA. However, I am in debt a little bit from it.  Everyone tells me ""the hard part is over!  You only have a few more months!""  but those months include smashing out a long thesis over a subject I absolutely do not enjoy.  I don't enjoy any of the program at all.  It is not what I want to do.  I'm not sure what career path is for me, but this is not it. 
Also, I live with my boyfriend of 2.5 years.  And... I've been considering breaking up with him.  A lot.  I just don't feel the same way about him, plus I don't want to be tied down to the same person since I was 21 (I'm 24).  It's hard to describe, but it hurts.  I've voiced it to him, but we live 3000 miles from any family, so we're stuck in this position. 
So, I'm not sure what to do.  Or if anybody has ever had anything like this feeling before.  That you are stuck in the life you are in, and there's nothing you can do to change it.  To top it off, I'm not sure if the depression is causing all these feelings about school/boyfriend, or if the school/boyfriend is causing the depression.  I just don't know. 
If anybody has any advice, I would really appreciate it.  I am new to depression, and very scared. 

TL;DR--have depression, hate current life and feel stuck, I feel like I can't escape without causing big problems.",Dataset_saving\train\pos\test_subject1445.xml

0,The anime is a major way for Bandai to market the game prior to release. It being delayed to the fall season will severely limit their marketing. ~~It also makes me wonder why Bandai didn't choose Sunrise to do God Eater since they own that studio.

Those looked pretty good to me but then again anime series production compared to film production is a different story in terms of budget and time management. That difference being budget and time are more constrained in TV anime production.

I also would have liked if we got information on the gaunas; their origin and why they're attacking humans. Some details on Ochiai's use of gauna biology to make his come back would've been nice too.

As for the finale, the continuation of the battle was a bit underwhelming compared to the last episode. Maybe the finale would have been better off as being purely a resolution episode. That would also mean condensing all the battle in the 11th episode, which I would not have liked.

There might be better choreographed action scenes out there but in terms of the full package that gets the heart racing this show's action might be the best of all the recent anime.

Some nitpicks: there were a few spots when it got choppy, some in slowmo and others during a few camera moves. There were a couple of Transformer-esque angles and super quick cuts that made things momentarily hard to follow.

That's why Deen, Satelight and Pierrot are still in business.

Also it's not all about disc sales. Some shows are made as promotional material for manga, LN, video games, merchandise and as part of a multimedia project.

0,"The number of shows indicates an increased interest in investing in anime. These shows are funded by manga, LN and video game publishers, toy/merchandise companies, TV Networks, marketing/advertising firms and other investors with varying interests. There's more to anime now than disc sales, merchandise sales and boosting manga sales. Using anime to promote LNs and video games is now common practice. We are seeing more multimedia projects that include anime. Then there's the relatively new found wealth known as streaming. Like I said, anime is the most ubiquitous as it has ever been with it being streamed on netflix, hulu, funimation, crunchyroll and other smaller streaming sites. Of course I also said this boom is not sustainable.

Regarding anime... remember how a cour used to be 13 episodes, and most shows were 2 cours? I think it's telling studios can't really afford buying airtime anymore. And the money certainly isn't going to employees.

Two cour late night shows are risky. Production committees have just gotten smarter. If the first cour is a success then they'll make another one. There's still bunch of two cour shows, most of them are daytime because TV networks don't want to reload their time slot every three months. Also studios don't usually pay for the airtime, the investors in the production committee do. Studios for the most part are hired contractors.

Saying that's unsustainable is pointing out the obvious and can be said about any industry going through a boom period.

It might have been worthwhile if he pointed out the declining relevance of physical media which will eventually affect the industry and the possibility of a demand for higher wage which will raise production costs.

However, Mr. Anno does not think that this will mean an end to anime as an artistic form of film. He points out the possibility of the centres of anime production moving to other areas of Asia with good conditions.

Certain parts of anime production are already being outsourced to other Asian studios because it's cheaper.

Obviously I'm painting very broad strokes, and no anime-watchers will struggle to produce counterexamples. Nevertheless, I think if they're honest with themselves, they'll see that anime generally sexualizes women by showing their virginal charm.

I really like that the show presented a reasonable voice to discuss the situation between CG vs traditional animation. The notion that CG and traditional animation can work together and animators from both sides can learn from each other reflects the collaboration between Ghibli and Polygon.

0,"Your complaint has been less and less of a problem lately, at least with the shows that I've been watching. Take Akame ga Kill for example. It's a rather low budget looking show but the dialogues are handled competently.

Let's use this scene as an example: 

Shot by shot breakdown

Establishing shot  a wide shot that gives a sense of time and place. The two characters are at a dinner table and its late afternoon (sunset colored sunlight)

Medium close-up of prime minister

High angle shot behind the prime minister with the camera tilting  yes this fits your complaint about characters talking while facing away from the camera but this actually serves a purpose. The camera tilting to the prince is a visual of the dialogue flow with him at the receiving end.

Medium close-up of the prince (continuity from the tilt shot)

Medium shot of prime minister (shot reverse shot). Prince holds up a paper and PM looks at it.

Cut to an eyeline match of what the PM is looking at, which is the paper with a list on it (again this is continuity from the last shot).

Close up of PM (with some badly done shallow focus) and then prince (shot reverse shot). The close ups give a better sense of their predicament.

Re-establishing shot, slow zoom out and fade out to black.

The cinematography wasn't elaborate. It wasn't compositionally heavy, although the arc in the background was used as a framing element and the ray of light as leading lines. But, IMO it wasn't stale shot making and had a decent grasp of visual continuity.",Dataset_saving\train\neg\test_subject1139.xml

In film, the camera is one of the most basic yet powerful tools of expression in a filmmaker's arsenal. As you are a film scholar, I'm sure you already know the power of a well-composed shot. My question is this: Anime relies a lot on static shots, largely for budgetary reasons (moving backgrounds, characters on a rotating dolly shot, etc. are hard to animate as perspective changes). There's not a lot of tracking/dolly/crane/steadicam shots in anime. Knowing how much the movement of the shot (or lack thereof) influences how the audience views a scene emotionally, how do you think has anime's reliance on static shots influenced its cinematic language? Do you think they've explored techniques in the static shot enough so that they don't have to rely so much on tracking shots to communicate the same emotions? I'm aware that there are numerous other things that affect the shot composition, but I wanted to ask about static shots specifically. 

**Moving the camera is actually something that didn't pop up much in motion picture history until relatively late. Early silent film cameras were bulky and heavy, and moving them was just too difficult. (You may have seen footage of a giant merry-go-round built for doing chase scenes in the silent era. The merry-go-round was for the actors and set, while the camera stayed on the ground.) This started to become less of a problem towards the end of the silent era, but then when talkies came the additional burden of the sound equipment and having to stay absolutely silent during shooting put a damper on adventurous camera technique. It took a long time for cinema to recover from the stiffness introduced by microphones. While cameras might have been able to shift around in place on a tripod, actually moving the camera, and the devices with which that could be done smoothly like dollies or jibs (mini-cranes for cameras) were things that had to be invented after that point, starting in the late 1930s. Hand-holding the camera was often too shaky until the Steadicam was invented, and that didn't become commonplace until the late 1980s.**

**Animation had similar limitations in that you could always move the camera, but doing so was a lot more trouble than it was usually worth. The low-budget nature of anime also meant that new inventions that made such things easier were slow in coming to Japan. Multi-plane animation techniques pioneered by Disney in the 30s and 40s (which you see as different layers of backgrounds panning across the screen at different speeds) didn't get used much in anime until the 1970s. And Japan pretty much skipped the early computer-aided drafting era of animation in the late 80s, not integrating computers into their workflows until early 2000s. So, for a very, very, very long time -- until the last decade, really -- anime creators were pretty much stuck with only the camera techniques they could draw by hand.** 

**Luckily, this worked quite well when combined with Japanese filmmaking, which leans heavily on the Yasujiro Ozu school of long, still shots, with cuts to close-ups for dramatic effect, and cuts to random little asides (a piece of litter, a glass of water -- Ozu called these ""pillow shots"") as a rhythmic pause, as if the life of a scene is taking a breath. The technical limitations of anime and that style of filmmaking work very well together, which is probably why the art form is so heavily influenced by it, whereas Japanese live action filmmaking has long since moved on.** 

**I think the economy with which the camera moves in anime tends to inherently give those shots more importance. A moving point of view shot happens so seldom, and the craft in which things move is so labored and clearly difficult, that it can't help but make an impression. It's similar to how body language is portrayed in anime: every twitch of a finger, every eye movement was a deliberate choice by the animators, and is important; it's never because an actor had a fly land on them or has an itch. That extra motion doesn't happen very often, so when it does, we take notice, and try to observe why it's happening. It adds meaning to a scene.** 

**There are still moving camera shots that take my breath away: hand drawn ones like the subway shoot-out in Kite, or the opening shot in The Heroic Legend of Arslan. There are moving camera shots that make me chuckle because they couldn't quite pull it off, like an early scene in Black Magic M-66 where the camera chases two people running through the woods, and the perspective of all of the passing trees gets completely screwed up. Even Paprika, which was an all-digital work, made innovative use of changing perspective in several shots, to breathtaking effect.** 

**Lately, I think some of the best, most pioneering work in terms of changing-perspective animation can be found in some of the insanely intricate swimming scenes in the current season of Free! That show is visually mind-blowing, even if all of the exposed flesh in that show does nothing for you.**

The head of ""strike anywhere"" matches contain an oxidizing agent such as potassium chlorate together with tetraphosphorus trisulfide, P4S3, glass and binder.  The phosphorus sulfide is easily ignited, the potassium chlorate decomposes to give oxygen, which in turn causes the phosphorus sulfide to burn more vigorously.


The head of safety matches are made of an oxidizing agent such as potassium chlorate, mixed with sulfur, fillers and glass powder.  The side of the box contains red phosphorus, binder and powdered glass.  The heat generated by friction when the match is struck causes a minute amount of red phosphorus to be converted to white phosphorus, which ingnites spontaneously in air.  This sets off the decomposition of potassium chlorate to give oxygen and potassium chloride.  The sulfur catches fire and ignites the wood.

KoS isn't really any worse than any anime in terms of FPS, it just looks more jarring when applied to CG.

0,"The Japanese aren't big time purchasers of DVD/BDs so it makes sense to maximize price in a limited market.


This [ANN article]( explains it better:

The High Prices... Explained!

To a Westerner, the Japanese DVD market seems horribly overpriced. With the average disc running over 7,000 (US$92) and only containing 2-4 episodes of a series, the cost of collecting a single show can easily run several hundred dollars -- more than many American fans spend in a single year. 

The prices actually stem from a business practice we used to have in America, too: rental pricing. Basically, back in the dawn of the home video business, the industry was constructed in a way where ""niche"" releases were only meant to sell a few thousand copies, mostly to video rental shops. Prices were high (typically $89.95 in America), but video shops benefited from having a wide and semi-exclusive selection of movies that normal people would never pay for. At those prices, only a few thousand sales could mean over a million dollars of revenue. Initially, video industry people didn't think there was much of a market in selling to collectors. 

But the fans proved them wrong. Otaku of all kinds (not just anime fans) started buying the videotapes and laserdiscs, and they bought them at those high prices that were intended just for video stores. There was no reason to lower it. **In fact, there were a few experiments to drop the price to a more affordable amount, but that usually resulted in a slight increase in sales -- not enough to make up for the drop in revenue.**

When you think about it, that makes sense. Most Japanese people live in much smaller homes, and with many more people than their Western counterparts. In most cases, it simply doesn't make sense for Japanese consumers to build a big home media library. Only the hardcore fans of a particular product will usually want to bother owning a tape or DVD, and everyone else relies on rental shops. Media is a specialty market, not a mass-market one, so prices have stayed astronomically high. 

The Japanese Otaku's desire to own anime even at high prices had an unexpected effect: as the rest of the economy tanked and video stores stopped buying every new video release, the otaku kept buying pretty much everything that got released. Before long, the few thousand fans that bought anime DVDs were supporting nearly the entire budget of a show. Even as the rest of the Japanese home video industry lowered their prices to varying degrees, anime stayed at the same high price. It's simply the only way most shows can ever make a profit.",Dataset_saving\train\neg\test_subject1139.xml

Totally agreed with this. The lack of balance between character development and storytelling leads to pretty bad pacing.

You're associating manipulation from a negative cognition. But did you know a positive connotation is referred to as: persuasion? People use each other all the time, for good or bad.

I told her if she did I wanted nothing to do with it. It was a moment of time where I didn't want to relive. I had my neck broken for fucks sake. I had to wear a neck brace for 3 months. Can you imagine being in high school for that duration? My friends were awesome about it, making fun of me- I liked it, it made it less threatening- but I still got looks and empathy from people. I just wanted it all to go away. I still keep the torn helmet from the crash to remind myself that life goes on. I'm not sure how old you are, but no one can force you to do anything, in the US-long as you're not incriminated. You can tell your therapist to eat shit, you're not talking. Sure, maybe the cops will be involved but so what? Plea the 5th. You don't have to say shit, if you don't want to. But don't repress that memory or else it will manifest from within.
